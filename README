 tempo-DB arduino sensor client
 
 This sketch connects an analog sensor to tempo-DB (http://www.tempo-DB.com)
 using a Wiznet Ethernet shield. You can use the Arduino Ethernet shield, or
 the Adafruit Ethernet shield, either one will work, as long as it's got
 a Wiznet Ethernet module on board. Also the Arduino Ethernet uses this module.
 
 This example has been modified to use the tempo-DB.com API. 
 To make it work:
 - register an account on http://www.tempo-DB.com 
 - create a database
 - note the APIkey and APIsecret, and enter them below
 - you may want to change the series key
 
 make sure you have the base64 library installed from:
 https://github.com/adamvr/arduino-base64
 
 Circuit:
 * Analog sensor attached to analog in 0
 * Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13
